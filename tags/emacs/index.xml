Among them, Mu4e is a mail client for Emacs and it is considered as an Emacs interface for mu the mail indexer. A typical example might be a mail sync program like isync which downloads mail from the remote Maildir folder to the local Maildir folder and then the mu indexer will be used to index the mail.</description></item><item><title>Emacs as Email Client</title><link>https://www.atomicl.net/posts/emacs_as_mail_client/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.atomicl.net/posts/emacs_as_mail_client/</guid><description>After completing my OSCP journey, I decided to take a short break from cybersecurity to do some cleaning workâ€¦
Finally today I executed the command: find ~/.thunderbird -type f -exec shred -u {} \;
I&amp;#39;ve been trying to move away from Thunderbird for a few months and today I completely switched to Emacs Mu4e with my GPG keys.
Even after all these years, I&amp;#39;m still amazed by certain technologies and Emacs is one of them.</description></item><item><title>Offline Email with Isync</title><link>https://www.atomicl.net/notes/isync/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.atomicl.net/notes/isync/</guid><description>Isync Install isync using your package manager, here we are installing the apt package manager, but use whatever package manager you are using:
sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt install isync We will use isync program to download mails to local Maildir folder. We can also use a program called offlineimap which is a bit slower but it can work on Windows. NOTE: isync is the name of the project, mbsync is the name of the executable.</description></item></channel></rss>
