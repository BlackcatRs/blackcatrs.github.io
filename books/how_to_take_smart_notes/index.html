Note Taking üìö</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-1 class=outline-text-2><p>The act of writing holds utmost significance in the realm of studying. Studying is a research and we don't study to do research, because it is a process of gaining unpredictable knowledge.</p><p>The result of a research must be public in academia and the result must contain a fact. A fact, by definition, can be reproduced by anyone, otherwise it is not a fact. And a fact does not belong to anyone, even to the researcher. In order to make a research public it should be in a written form that can be read by someone.</p><p>Your writing needs to be published to receive feedback, be it positive or negative. This feedback loop is crucial for our learning process, allowing us to glean insights and explore new ideas. The review of a research is way of publishing a research, so a student handover all resources to a professor or lecture. Even the handout <sup class=footnote-reference><a id=footnote-reference-1 href=#footnote-1>1</a></sup> for a presentation discussed with fellow students is a written piece made public as the discussion concern the research.</p><p>Indeed, writing serves as a medium for contemplating <sup class=footnote-reference><a id=footnote-reference-2 href=#footnote-2>2</a></sup> ideas. According to Richard Feynman, this thinking process should be conducted on paper rather than solely within our minds.</p><p>This is why knowledge acquisition and presentation - written form published for feedback - are linked to each other. Writing is not only way to make your research public, but writing helps you be more focused during your studies by writing in your own words and connecting them to previously learned knowledge. Finally regular, publishing regularly eliminates the fear of failure.</p><p>Writing is not a linear process in which we start by choosing a topic, then read some related literature to answer a problem and finalize it with publication. We can't just find a topic to write about or a problem to solve without any knowledge. We always start writing or reading based on our existing knowledge and understanding of things, not from scratch.</p><p>And we cannot store this knowledge in an unreliable place like in our brain and it will not store it in its entirety.</p><p>This is where a good note-taking system comes in handy: we read something, come up with ideas, think about it, write it down and store it in a structured way. If interest does not persist on this topic, we can move on to another and if we have enough valuable information, we can publish the writings.</p><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-2>1.1. Prepare Your Brain üß†</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-3><ol><li>First at all make a flexible work-flow which will not come out of planning but from deliberate practice and experience. A flexible workflow is characterized by the anticipation of actions, and this anticipation does not mean predicting future events but rather adapting predefined events or tasks based on unforeseen situations.
Otherwise, it will require us to focus again and again on one particular task and build a routine for us, but a routine must be defined by us explicitly and not by tasks.
Every task should be treated with same attention in order to a task to adaptable to any unforeseen situation and also avoid multitasking.</li><li>The learning process is not gauged by the quantity of pages written daily but by the depth of comprehension and the assimilation of new ideas.
Write down ideas that pops in your mind or found while reading a page with bibliographic details in your own words, which will prevent filling the brain's limited short-term memory space. Once you have finished reading, expand on the captured idea and make connections to your existing notes.
But noticing relevant information isn't always straightforward due to a phenomenon called <code class=verbatim>Confirmation bias</code> <sup class=footnote-reference><a id=footnote-reference-3 href=#footnote-3>3</a></sup> which involves focusing solely on information that aligns with or supports your existing ideas and ignoring contradictory elements.
So, pay attention to all relevant information or ideas, regardless of whether they support our current ideas. Additionally, being open to contradictory arguments without compromising progress is essential. Embracing both supporting and contradictory elements allows us to make informed decisions and possibly arrive at new insights.</li><li>Our brain has a fixed way of thinking that relies on small pieces of recently acquired information. Our brain only sees what we expect to see and not what is actually presented.
Consider the case of mathematician Abraham Wald during World War II, tasked with enhancing the protection of Royal Air Force planes by armoring the places which are often took bullet (Mangel and Samaniego 1984). Instead of advising the RAF to cover areas with visible bullet holes, he recommended covering the parts that remained untouched.
This unconventional approach stemmed from the realization that the RAF's assumption was solely based on the returned planes with bullet holes, neglecting those that did not return and might have damage in critical areas like fuel tanks.
This cognitive bias applies to all field of activity and is called <code class=verbatim>survivorship bias</code> because we focus on individuals or things that "survived" a process, ignoring those that failed.
The key to overcoming survivorship bias is to ask counterfactual questions, such as "what if?". For instance, what would happen if the bullet hit a different area instead of the already hit area?</li><li>Creativity arises from our ability to abstract <sup class=footnote-reference><a id=footnote-reference-4 href=#footnote-4>4</a></sup> - extract general ideas, concepts or principles from a context, and to redefine them. These abilities are not only necessary for the creative process but also for solving technical problems. One's ability to abstract and redefine a problem will result in an adaptable solution.
In some cases, it is necessary to rediscover the problem to redefine the question, of course without changing its original meaning, to use an already existing solution. This helps to understand what type of answer we can expect by asking the question in this way and what answer is missing from the initial question.</li><li>Keep ideas simple, and simplicity doesn't necessarily mean ease. Take the example of buying stocks low and selling them high. We interpret this idea as buying stocks at a lower price and selling them at a high price as a good deal, but the only thing that matters is the real value of the stock we are buying, as the said Warren Buffett, investor and teacher, who ignores the price of days gone by.
A stock is a share of a company whose price is defined by the market, that is, by the number of supply and demand. This supply and demand depends on the participant and the value of the stock. We therefore need to understand the business of the company we are buying the shares, the competition and the technologies involved.</li><li>We have the best chance to change our behaviour over the long term if we start with a realistic idea about the difficulties of behavioural change (Dean 2013). The trick is not to try to break with old habits and also not to use willpower to force oneself to do something else, but to strategically build up new habits that have a chance to replace the old ones.</li></ol></div></div></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-3>2. What is a Zettelkasten üóÉÔ∏è ?</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-2><p>Zettelkasten, a note-taking system, gains inspiration from the methodology of Niklas Luhmann, a renowned sociologist. German for "slip box," Zettelkasten involves creating small, individual notes (Zettels) for discrete pieces of information. These notes are then organized and linked in a systematic way, facilitating the synthesis of ideas and enabling creative thinking, making it a powerful tool for researchers, writers, and learners.</p><p>Luhmann showcased effective idea synthesis and creativity using a slip-box. Over 30 years, he published 58 books and hundreds of articles, translations not included. He wrote on law, politics, economy, communication, art, education, epistemology, and even love.</p><div id=outline-container-headline-4 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-4>2.1. Make Notes üóíÔ∏è</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-3><p>He uses two slip-boxes for note taking, first a bibliographical <sup class=footnote-reference><a id=footnote-reference-5 href=#footnote-5>5</a></sup> one which contains references and brief notes on the content of literature. Finally, the main slip-box which contains his collected and generated ideas from the notes in bibliographic slip-box.</p><p>When ever he found some interesting information while reading he take bibliographic information on one side the card and brief notes in other side of the card.</p><p>Quickly after (hours or days), he review previously captured notes pertinence with his current project, thinking, or interest. He then elaborates further on the captured ideas on a new piece of paper. This involves taking the idea from its initial context and placing it into another context without much altering the original meaning. He creates only one idea for each note and places it into the main slip-box. This note is written in grammatically correct form as a final output, explicitly referencing the literature from where he got the idea, rather than a quick note formed with keywords. More often, new final notes are related to existing notes, forming a continuity.</p><p>He then add reference to new note from other notes somewhere else in the slip-box and/or add reference to existing notes to form connection between related notes.</p><p>The notes are organized using numbers. If a new note is relevant, or referred to a an existing note numbered <code class=verbatim>22</code> then the related note receives the number <code class=verbatim>23</code>. If <code class=verbatim>23</code> exists then get <code class=verbatim>22a</code>. For example a note with number <code class=verbatim>21/3d7a7</code> follows a note with the number <code class=verbatim>21/3d7a6</code>.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-5 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-5>2.2. Reference System üîó</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-5 class=outline-text-3><p>A bibliographical slip-box or index system that points to one or two notes serving as entry points to a topic or idea. These notes act as an entry point to subjects to which some existing notes belong.</p><p>We need to reference a note using keywords from the index system as an entry point to a note in main slip-box. We don't want to choose a keyword that best suits a note. Instead, we <strong>select a keyword that represents a situation in which I want to come across this note</strong>.</p><p>For example, the following text which indicates that people estimate the probability of an event occurring if they can visualize it:</p><blockquote><p>Tversky/Kahneman (1973) showed in an experiment that people are more likely to overestimate the likelihood of an event to happen if they are able to conceive it well and in detail than if it were abstract.</p></blockquote><p>If an economist reading this text and working on decision-making, it tells him to choose a project that is easy to visualize rather than a profitable project. The keyword he will probably choose will therefore be "capital allocation problems", i.e. in which project to invest.</p><p>The chosen keyword is therefore out of the initial context and anchored in the economic context. We can retrieve keywords by looking at notes, but these represent already existing or obvious ideas and not new ones.</p><p>Good keywords are usually not already mentioned as words in the note.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-6 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-6>2.3. Make Connection üåê</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-6 class=outline-text-3><p>Once a link is created to the note serving as an overview and entry point to a topic within the index system, continue to create note-to-note links. This involves creating links to another related note by reviewing and comparing old notes with newly created ones.</p><blockquote><p>Albert Rothenberg suggests that the construction of oppositions is the most reliable way of generating new ideas (Rothenberg 1971; 1996; 2015).</p></blockquote><p>Comparing notes is an important skill that allows to visualize differences between apparently similar concepts, or connections between apparently different ideas. The neurobiologist James Zull states that understanding something is done by comparing our existing related knowledge. Focusing on a subject means scanning different information for our brain and comparing with them (Zull 2002). And this will increases the chances of creating new notes.</p><p>On some occasions we make decisions based on our intuition without any explicit reason and intuition is not a replacement of rationality or knowledge but rather is the result of our acquired experiences and knowledge based on which we make decisions (cf . Ahrens 2014).</p><p>In order to make decision based on intuition we need a testing space such as an environment consist of open-minded experts and intellectuals to discussed in liberty or our slip-box which will offer the exact same possibility.</p><p>A theoretical toolbox helps build a latticework (network) of mental models and these mental models must be combined with our direct and indirect experiences. But we can also learn from other experiences related to our mental models. Using slip-boxes ‚Äì add and connect notes, emerge new topics/patterns that will build a "lattice of mental models".</p></div></div></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-7 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-7>3. Zettelkasten Method Overview üìñ</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-7 class=outline-text-2><p>The Zettelkasten method consist of two types of notes, namely <code class=verbatim>Fleeting notes</code> and <code class=verbatim>Permanent notes</code>:</p><ol><li>Fleeting notes are only reminders of information or an idea that you think interesting and don't want to forget. This can written in any form and end up in the trash withing a day or two.
For example, writing a piece of interesting information or idea somewhere when reading a text (or doing something) without interrupting the previous action. We can also take "Fleeting literature notes" when reading which contain an reference to source.</li><li>Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and constitute the text which explains in detail the ideas.
They are always stored either in the reference system or, written as if for print (publish), in the slip-box.</li></ol><p><em>Project notes, Zettelkasten also allow for project-related note-taking, which means storing literature and main notes in a separate project-specific location, avoid messing notes with actual notes in a slip-box. This allows the Zettelkasten system to be used for short-term note-taking (until project ends) without interrupting the long-term note-taking system.</em></p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-8 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-8>4.
