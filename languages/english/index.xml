Ever wondered why our brains sometimes prioritize recently learned info over what&amp;#39;s truly important? ü§î It&amp;#39;s like having a mental &amp;#34;Last In, First Out&amp;#34; (LIFO) system! üîÑ
The brain tends to overestimate the importance of facts that are easily retrieved, creating a &amp;#34;Feature-positive&amp;#34; effect. üåü This means we might neglect valuable, harder-to-recall information in favor of the latest tidbits.

üí° That is exactly what applies to cybersecurity. We can&amp;rsquo;t just explain a topic in cybersecurity without addressing related topics like networks, programming, systems, and other vulnerabilities.
What I learned after some of these years of study is that learning pentesting/cybersecurity is not a linear process, you can&amp;rsquo;t start from scratch.

Among them, Mu4e is a mail client for Emacs and it is considered as an Emacs interface for mu the mail indexer. A typical example might be a mail sync program like isync which downloads mail from the remote Maildir folder to the local Maildir folder and then the mu indexer will be used to index the mail.</description></item><item><title>Offline Email with Isync</title><link>https://www.atomicl.net/notes/isync/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.atomicl.net/notes/isync/</guid><description>Isync Install isync using your package manager, here we are installing the apt package manager, but use whatever package manager you are using:
sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt install isync We will use isync program to download mails to local Maildir folder. We can also use a program called offlineimap which is a bit slower but it can work on Windows. NOTE: isync is the name of the project, mbsync is the name of the executable.</description></item><item><title>Pentester's Toolbox</title><link>https://www.atomicl.net/notes/toolbox/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.atomicl.net/notes/toolbox/</guid><description>Table of Content&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;&amp;#xa0;toc 1.

Bash (/bin/bash) is a popular shell on most if not all Linux systems, and it‚Äôs normally the default shell for user accounts.
We can also change or define a shell for a user to provide more functionality or block access to the shell using /sbin/nologin.</description></item><item><title>Install FTP Server</title><link>https://www.atomicl.net/notes/install_ftp_server/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.atomicl.net/notes/install_ftp_server/</guid><description>Introduction FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol which is used for transferring file between a centralized server and clients over a network.

The communication between FTP client and server is done by using two type of connection namely control connection and a data connection.</description></item><item><title>Programs I Use</title><link>https://www.atomicl.net/ecosystem/software/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.atomicl.net/ecosystem/software/</guid><description>Summary I&amp;rsquo;m a privacy conscious person and use free, minimalist, terminal-based programs on my computer that are easy to maintain in long term. I think a good software should answer your needs rather than the author&amp;rsquo;s. You can find my custom configuration within my .dotfiles folder.
Basic Operating System/Distribution
I like to start with a minimal operating system and then add software as needed. This way I am able to master most of the software on my system and learn things.</description></item><item><title>DWM - Dynamic Window Manager</title><link>https://www.atomicl.net/projects/blackdwm/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.atomicl.net/projects/blackdwm/</guid><description>This is a fork of DWM by suckless.org, an extremely fast, small and dynamic window manager for X.

These programs interact with the gpg-agent daemon through a socket to request the secret key and request for the secret key.
If the gpg-agent process has the key, it provides it to gpg. If not, it tries to load the encrypted key from your keyring and prompts you for the key&amp;rsquo;s passphrase.</description></item></channel></rss>
